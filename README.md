# Hello-world
Lawyer learning to code
Hello guys
I did basic programming at school - Turbo Pascal lol!
I want to get involved with projects to improve my skills.
I am currently looking at Python and I think my current goal is to get skills to be able to setup my own website to 
showcase my photos and I'm working on writing a simple program to determine the distribution of an intestate estate in terms of South African intestate law
